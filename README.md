# PRIVUS Privacy Capability Model  
by Elytra Security  
Version 1.0

PRIVUS is Elytra Security’s six-stage **Privacy Capability Model** designed for Indian and global organisations implementing the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA)**, **ISO 27701**, **ISO 27001**, **GDPR**, and **CERT-In** readiness.

It provides a structured way to assess, improve, and institutionalise privacy capabilities across the entire organisation — from governance to engineering.

## 1. What is PRIVUS?
PRIVUS is a **capability model**, not just a maturity scale.  
It defines how organisations evolve from ad-hoc privacy practices to fully strategic, integrated, and continuously improving privacy operations.

### The six PRIVUS levels:
1. **Preliminary (P)**  
2. **Responsive (R)**  
3. **Integrated (I)**  
4. **Validated (V)**  
5. **Unified (U)**  
6. **Strategic (S)**  

### The eight PRIVUS domains:
1. Governance  
2. RoPA & Data Mapping  
3. Consent  
4. DSR Handling  
5. Security & Telemetry  
6. Vendor Oversight  
7. Retention & Deletion  
8. Privacy-by-Design & Engineering Alignment
