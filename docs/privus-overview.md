\# PRIVUS Privacy Capability Model  

by Elytra Security  

Version 1.0



PRIVUS is Elytra Security’s six-stage \*\*Privacy Capability Model\*\* designed to help organisations operationalise the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) and align with ISO 27701, ISO 27001, GDPR, CERT-In advisories, and related Indian regulatory expectations.



It is built in India, for India, with a global alignment lens.

\## 1. What PRIVUS is (and is not)



PRIVUS is a \*\*capability model\*\*.



It describes how an organisation’s privacy function \*actually works\* in practice across governance, processes, records, engineering, and telemetry – not just how many policies exist or how many checklists are complete.



It is \*\*not\*\*:

\- a simple 1–5 or 1–6 numeric maturity scale,

\- a replacement for DPDPA, ISO, or GDPR,

\- a legal opinion or statutory interpretation.



Instead, PRIVUS provides a \*\*structured way to answer\*\*:



> “How ready are we to run privacy as a sustained, evidence-backed capability – and what does it take to move to the next level?”



---



\## 2. The six PRIVUS levels



PRIVUS defines six progressive capability levels:



1\. \*\*Preliminary (P)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Ad-hoc practices, fragmented ownership, limited documentation.  

&nbsp;  - High regulatory and operational risk.



2\. \*\*Responsive (R)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Some policies and roles exist; responses are largely reactive.  

&nbsp;  - Efforts spike when an issue, audit, or regulator query appears.



3\. \*\*Integrated (I)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Governance, records, and processes are connected across functions.  

&nbsp;  - Day-to-day operations start to reflect privacy by default.



4\. \*\*Validated (V)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Controls and processes are tested, evidenced, and reviewed.  

&nbsp;  - Internal assurance and audit play a visible role.



5\. \*\*Unified (U)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Privacy is embedded across business, technology, legal, security, and vendors.  

&nbsp;  - Metrics, telemetry, and automation support scalable compliance.



6\. \*\*Strategic (S)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Privacy becomes a board-level, market-facing strength.  

&nbsp;  - Used to build trust, differentiation, and long-term resilience.



Maturity deepens \*\*left → right\*\*:  

from \*\*Preliminary\*\* to \*\*Strategic\*\*, expanding like vision beams from an eye – the core visual metaphor of PRIVUS.

\## 3. The eight PRIVUS domains



PRIVUS evaluates privacy capability across eight core domains:



1\. \*\*Governance\*\*  

&nbsp;  Roles, accountability, policies, oversight, risk management.



2\. \*\*RoPA \& Data Mapping\*\*  

&nbsp;  Records of processing, data flows, system inventories, classification.



3\. \*\*Consent\*\*  

&nbsp;  Notices, consent capture, withdrawal, logging, and alignment to purposes.



4\. \*\*DSR Handling\*\*  

&nbsp;  Data Subject / Data Principal requests: access, correction, erasure, grievance, and timelines.



5\. \*\*Security \& Telemetry\*\*  

&nbsp;  Logging, monitoring, MXDR, incident response, breach readiness, and alignment of security events with privacy impact.



6\. \*\*Vendor Oversight\*\*  

&nbsp;  Contracts, data processing agreements, onboarding, monitoring, and offboarding of processors and partners.



7\. \*\*Retention \& Deletion\*\*  

&nbsp;  Retention schedules, deletion workflows, minimisation, and evidence of actual execution.



8\. \*\*Privacy-by-Design \& Engineering Alignment\*\*  

&nbsp;  Integration of privacy requirements into SDLC, architecture reviews, and engineering practices.

\## 4. Intended use



The public PRIVUS framework is intended for:



\- Internal self-assessment and planning  

\- Benchmarking current capability level  

\- Structuring privacy transformation roadmaps  

\- Supporting board and management reporting  

\- Aligning cross-functional teams around a common language



It is not, by itself, a certification or assurance instrument.



Elytra Security offers \*\*licensed assessments, evidence templates, heatmaps, and reports\*\* built on PRIVUS for organisations that need formal evaluation, implementation support, or board-ready outputs.



---



\## 5. Relationship to DPDPA and other frameworks



PRIVUS is mapped (at a high level) to:



\- Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (India)  

\- ISO 27001 (information security management)  

\- ISO 27701 (privacy information management)  

\- GDPR / UK-GDPR (where relevant)  

\- CERT-In directions and incident expectations  



The intent is to provide \*\*one capability view\*\* across multiple obligations, without duplicating the text of any standard or law.



Detailed, operational mappings and implementation guidance are part of the \*\*licensed PRIVUS-PRO toolkit\*\* and are not published in this repository.
